        <h3>Risk Tolerance:</h3>
        <p>Risk tolerance is the level of risk an investor is willing to take. Risk can mean you are willing to play big to win big. You are more likely to put more “chips on the table” in hopes of hitting the jackpot. Risk is also about tolerating the potential for losses, the ability to withstand market swings like economic recessions, and the inability to predict what’s ahead.</p>
        <h3>Risk Capacity:</h3>
        <p>Risk capacity and risk tolerance are generally independent of each other. Risk capacity can usually be expressed as a dollar figure that you would be comfortable with losing before it starts to impact your lifestyle. This dollar figure will likely fluctuate as you approach major milestones such as taking on mortgages and other liabilities, or sending a kid off to college, or getting closer to retirement. Financial shock like job loss, or accident that comes with expensive medical can also affect your investment decisions by altering the amount of risk you're able to afford.</p>

        <h3>Asset Class Investing:</h3>
        <p>There are different asset classes that a portfolio should include in order to be balanced. A balanced portfolio means that it contains predetermined and deliberate proportions of your invested money in each asset class. Stocks are traditionally recognized as higher risk and higher return compared to their Bonds counterparts. Cash represents no risk as it is fully liquid (can be accessed at any time and is not affected by market trends) but is susceptible to inflation. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each asset class is import to be able to wisely invest your hard earned money according to your financial goals.</p>
