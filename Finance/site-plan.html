      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>1.	Have you ever wondered where to start with investing? 
          Im sure you know that you want to retire eventually. Are you really sure what it takes to get to the point where you will feel totally comfortable when that time comes? I am building a website that helps people understand their risk tolerance level. 
          This helps them to put their investments in a portfolio that is customized specifically for them as an individual. 
          What this means for the user is that they can start investing now so that they will actually reach their financial goals by the time they reach retirement. 
          Many firms will happily take your without accounting for your age/ goals for retirement, risk level tolerance, and other important aspects of customizing a portfolio. 
          My website is the solution to this problem. Our easy-to-use interface will allow a stress free start to meaningful, goal-oriented investing.

        Risk Level Assesment:
        The people that use this website are interested in assessing their personal risk level so that they can invest their money wisely. They have financial goals that they want to achieve, they just want a little direction and advice to get there. If this sounds like you, continue below to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goals:
        Here at Desert Financial, we are sure you know that you want to retire eventually.

Having a risk tolerance level that is measured and then displayed as a simple number will help you to put their investments in a portfolio that is customized specifically for you as an individual.

      <h3>Know your terms before you invest.</h3>
      <p>
        Risk Tolerance:
        Risk tolerance is the level of risk an investor is willing to take. Risk can mean you are willing to play big to win big. You are more likely to put more “chips on the table” in hopes of hitting the jackpot. Risk is also about tolerating the potential for losses, the ability to withstand market swings like economic recessions, and the inability to predict what’s ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk Capacity:
	      Risk capacity and risk tolerance are generally independent of each other. Risk capacity can usually be expressed as a dollar figure that you would be comfortable with losing before it starts to impact your lifestyle. This dollar figure will likely fluctuate as you approach major milestones such as taking on mortgages and other liabilities, or sending a kid off to college, or getting closer to retirement. Financial shock like job loss, or accident that comes with expensive medical can also affect your investment decisions by altering the amount of risk you're able to afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asset Class Investing:
	      There are different asset classes that a portfolio should include in order to be balanced. A balanced portfolio means that it contains predetermined and deliberate proportions of your invested money in each asset class. Stocks are traditionally recognized as higher risk and higher return compared to their Bonds counterparts. Cash represents no risk as it is fully liquid (can be accessed at any time and is not affected by market trends) but is susceptible to inflation. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each asset class is import to be able to wisely invest your hard earned money according to your financial goals.
